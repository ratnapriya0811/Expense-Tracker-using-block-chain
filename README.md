- **Immutable Logs:** All records are saved on-chain and cannot be tampered with.

## ðŸš€ Future Scope
- Add user authentication and wallet linking.
- Summarize expenses by categories (e.g., food, travel, utilities).
- Allow exporting expenses to a downloadable report (e.g., CSV or JSON).
- Integrate with mobile/web frontends for user-friendly interfaces.
- Implement expense limits and monthly budgets with alerts.
